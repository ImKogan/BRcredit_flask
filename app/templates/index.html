<h3>About BRcredit</h3>
<div id="chart" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

<div class="application-information">
	<p>BRcredit was conceived as a solution to the exorbitant APR credit card rates in Brazil. In our analysis, the abnormally high rates facing the Brazilian consumer stem from two factors.</p>
	<div class="borderless">
		<ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">The near monopoly of the top five (Itau, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Santander, Caixa) institutions in the credit market</li>
			<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">The lack of complete and reliable information that would allow lenders to distinguish between high and medium risk applicants</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>While the first factor can be theoretically addressed by new entrants into the market, the second factor requires a more comprehensive solution. 

		Our analysis views the consumer credit market in 3 tiers:
		<div class="borderless">
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">Top tier of consumers (< 10%) who enjoy relatively low APR rates of approximately 100%</li>
				<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">A middle tier (~30%) that is subject to the average rates that have been as high as 400%</li>
				<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">Finally, a lower tier that generally has limited or no access to established credit sources</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>While the brazilian market has seen some new entrants (Goldman Sachs report covered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-sees-big-potential-for-fintech-in-brazil.html">here</a> in the NYT), the market is large and fragmented enough to acommodate many more entrants.</p>

		<h5><b>Enter BRcredit</b></h5>
		<p>BRcredit is a multi-staged approach that takes advantage of the market opportunity (relative monopoly and high rates) while tackling the barrier of low quality information.</p>
		<p>
			Stage 1 - Offer lower rates to medium or high risk applicants - for whom data is unreliable or incomplete - provided a guarantor with low risk credentials. Although some higher risk individuals would be unable to provide such a guarantor, many would. During this stage BRcredit will be able to study the credit habits of many consumers who are either discouraged from the current market by prohibitive rates, donâ€™t carry a balance, or default on their loans.

							This application is a prototype. To get a sense of how to use it:
							<div class="borderless">
								<ul class="list-group">
									<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">
										Create two accounts. One will be the "guarantor" account, the second, the 'borrpwer" account. An account will require a valid email address
									</li>
									<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">
										In the "borrower" account follow instructions in the 'Connect Guarantor' link
									</li>
									<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">
										In the "guarantor" account accept the request to connect
									</li>
									<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">
										The "borrower" can fill and submit a loan application
									</li>
									<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">
										The "guarantor" can submit his information for the loan application.
									</li>
									<li class="list-group-item" style="border: none">
										As this is a prototype - a loan application is set to be automatically 'approved'. Both borrower and guarantor can folllow the link 'Manage Loans' to view and make payments.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<p>Some aspects of the process may appear peculiar - such as interest rates denominated in monthly terms - fixed installment plans and so on. These are based on the specifics of the Brazilian market. The latter especially so - as the option to 'parcelar' - to pay in installments is practically ubiquitous throughout the consumer economy. Any purchase - from vacations to flights, mattresses to houswares can be paid in installments. These are financed by the vendor or a third party. This feature of Brazilian consumer culture is in our opinion a strong positive predictor for the viability of our model.</p>
